               films of BaTiO₃ (BTO) grown on (001)
               SrTiO₃ substrates. Piezoresponse force
               microscope was performed using an atomic force microscope
               equipped with an interferometric displacement sensor allowing
               direct quantification of electromechanical coupling coefficients
               in BTO free from unwanted background contributions. We find that
               80-nm-thick films exhibit a d₃₃ of
               approximately 20.5 pm/V,
               but as the thickness is reduced, the d₃₃ reduces to
               less than 2 pm/V for a 10 nm film. To explain the atomistic
               origin of the effect, we performed molecular dynamics
               simulations with a recently developed ab initio-derived reactive
               force field, constructed using the ReaxFF framework. Simulations

  editor   = "Martin, Lane W",
  abstract = "Epitaxial strain has been widely used to modify the crystal and
              domain structure, and ultimately the dielectric, ferroelectric,
              and pyroelectric responses of ferroelectric thin-films for a wide
              variety of applications including memories, transducers, energy
              harvesters, sensors, and many more. Traditionally, the ability to
              engineer materials using epitaxial strain has been confined to a
              limited range of materials systems which are closely lattice
              matched to commercially available substrates. In turn,
              considering the PbZr₁−ₓ TiₓO₃ system, a model ferroelectric,
              study of strain effects has been primarily limited to the Ti-rich
              variants where a wealth of closely lattice matched substrates
              (∼±1%) exists, enabling nearly-coherently-strained films to
              be obtained. While these studies have generated a wealth of
              knowledge on the basic effects of epitaxial strain and have
              demonstrated the ability to enhance ferroelectric
              susceptibilities, these improvements have only been incremental.
              In the present work, we seek to expand the bounds of epitaxial
              strain engineering through the use of chemistry, controlled
              epitaxial strain (and relaxation), and compositional and strain
              gradients with the directive of generating phase competition and
              high-energy ferroelastic domain structures to enhance
              ferroelectric susceptibilities. We, for the first time, grow
              epitaxial thin films of PbZr₁−ₓTiₓO₃ across the compositional
              phase diagram, and show that the rate of strain relaxation is
              significantly enhanced at the morphotropic phase boundary
              (PbZr₀.₅₂Ti₀.₄₈O₃), as the result of the high adaptability of the
              crystal and domain structure. Despite the appearance of nearly
              ``relaxed'' crystal structures, PbZr₀.₅₂Ti₀.₄₈O₃ thin films were
              shown to exhibit significantly different dielectric responses
              when grown on various substrates. Highlighting the more nuanced
              effects of partial strain relaxation in tuning ferroelectric
              susceptibilities. We then proceed to extend the bounds of
              epitaxial strain by growing compositionally-graded
              heterostructures which facilitates the retention of strains in
              excess of 3.5%, large strain gradients (∼4.35×10−5 m −1),
              and has the ability to stabilize the tetragonal crystal and
              domain structure, in PbZr₁−ₓTiₓO₃ solid solutions that are
              rhombohedral in the bulk. Furthermore, we show that by varying
              the compositional-gradient form (in terms of the nature of the
              compositional gradient and heterostructure thickness) that it is
              possible to generate large built-in potentials, which
              significantly suppresses the dielectric response, but has minimal
              detrimental impact on the ferroelectric and pyroelectric
              susceptibilities, giving rise to dramatically enhanced
              pyroelectric figures of merit. Additionally, we show that the
              magnitude of the built-in potential does not follow predictions
              based on the magnitude of the strain gradient alone, and instead,
              is enhanced by local strain gradients which occur when traversing
              chemistries associated with structural phase boundaries (where
              there are abrupt changes in the lattice parameter) and at/near
              ferroelastic domain boundaries. Finally, we explore the nanoscale
              response of these ferroelastic domains in compositionally-graded
              heterostructures using a combination of transmission electron
              microscopy-based nanobeam diffraction strain mapping and
              multi-dimensional band-excitation switching spectroscopy. We
              observe that the presence of compositional and strain gradients
              can preferentially stabilize highly-energetic, needle-like
              domains, which under electrical excitation are highly labile in
              the out-of-plane direction (while remaining spatially fixed in
              the plane). These labile domain walls act like domain wall
              springs (enhancing the magnitude of the built-in potential),
              transferring elastic energy between the a and c domains
              (depending on the direction of the applied bias), and giving rise
              to locally enhanced piezoresponse at the a domains, as the result
              of a switching mechanism where the a domains expand towards the
              free surface or are nearly excluded from the film (once again,
              depending on the direction of applied bias). These studies
              demonstrate the efficacy of compositional and strain gradients as
              a new modality of strain engineering capable of significantly
              altering the crystal and domain structure, and ferroelectric
              susceptibilities of ferroelectric thin films inconceivable in the
              absence of compositional/strain gradients.",

               accomplished by chemical substitution-as in BaₓSr₁₋ₓTiO₃,
               the material widely investigated for microwave devices in which
               the dielectric constant (epsilon(r)) at GHz frequencies is tuned
               by applying a quasi-static electric field. Heterogeneity
               associated with chemical substitution in such films, however,
               can broaden this phase transition by hundreds of degrees, which
               is detrimental to tunability and microwave device performance.
               An alternative way to adjust T(c) in ferroelectric films is
               strain. Here we show that epitaxial strain from a newly

              Subsequent studies of the dielectric and ferroelectric properties
              reveal films with low leakage currents facilitating the
              measurement of low-loss hysteresis loops down to measurement
              frequencies of 30 mHz and dielectric response at background dc
              bias fields as large as 850 kV/cm. Despite a seeming
              insensitivity of the crystal structure to the epitaxial strain,
              the polarization and switching characteristics are found to vary
              with substrate. The elastic constraint from the substrate
              produces residual strains that dramatically alter the

              contributions to the dielectric permittivity and suppressing
              field-induced structural reorientation. These results demonstrate
              that substrate mediated epitaxial strain of PbZr₀.₅₂Ti₀.₄₈O₃ is
              more complex than in conventional ferroelectrics with discretely
              defined phases, yet can have a marked effect on the material and

              structures and property evolution are found despite films

               understand growth dynamics therein, it is common to leverage in
               situ spectroscopies, such as reflection high-energy electron
               diffraction (RHEED), to monitor surface crystallinity. Most
               commercial systems rely on video-rate cameras operating at
               60-120 Hz that lack sufficient temporal resolution to capture
               growth dynamics at practical deposition frequencies. Here, a
               high-speed platform to record in situ dynamics via RHEED at >500
               Hz is implemented. An open-source analysis package is designed
               to fit diffraction spots to 2D Gaussians, allowing single-pulse
               surface reconstruction kinetics extraction. Using
               homoepitaxially deposited (001)-oriented SrTiO₃ as a model
               system, we demonstrate how high-speed RHEED can provide
               real-time insight into growth processes obscured by slower
               acquisition systems. By fitting the single-pulse intensity to a
               set of exponential functions, we observe changes in the
               characteristic decay time and mechanism correlated to the
               substrate step width and surface termination. We observe
               distinct surface effects, with diffraction intensity decaying on
               lower-energy TiO₂-terminated surfaces and stabilizing on SrO- or
               mixed-terminated surfaces. Similarly, using an exponential

               decreases with increased density of bonding sites associated
               with mixed termination and narrower step widths. Ultimately,

               for a diverse range of applications, use of this material is
               limited by its poor electrical leakage. This work demonstrates
               some of the most resistive BiFeO₃ thin films reported to date
               via defect engineering achieved via high‐energy ion bombardment.
               High leakage in as‐grown BiFeO₃ thin films is shown to be due to
               the presence of moderately shallow isolated trap states, which
               form during growth. Ion bombardment is shown to be an effective
               way to reduce this free carrier transport (by up to ≈4
               orders of magnitude) by trapping the charge carriers in
               bombardment‐induced, deep‐lying defect complexes and clusters.
               The ion bombardment is also found to give rise to an increased
               resistance to switching as a result of an increase in defect
               concentration. This study demonstrates a systematic
               ion‐dose‐dependent increase in the coercivity, extension of the

              (IPLD). In this manner, the evolution of the STO bulk
              conductivity was tracked at 300 °C during STO thin film
              deposition and during deposition on a quartz cover to isolate
              illumination effects from deposition effects. These measurements
              revealed an increasing bulk conductivity during covered
              measurements. Impedance spectroscopy under applied bias voltages
              indicates that these changes are not caused by photovoltages but
              by an enhanced oxygen incorporation compensated by electron hole
              generation under UV illumination. This enhanced conductivity
              persists after illumination. The combination of across-plane and

              responsible for this stoichiometry change corresponds to a p(O₂)

               examples: Magnetic coupling through non-magnetic layers depends
               sensitively on the spacer layer thickness [526]; tunneling
               devices require insulator spacer layers of precisely controlled
               thickness (implying negligible roughness) [527]; and spin
               dependent electron transport through interfaces is strongly

               requires controlled growth and interface engineering on an

               films grown on TiO₂-terminated (001) SrTiO₃ (STO) substrates
               usually transitions from 2D layer-by-layer to step-flow at the
               first few growth periods, which is not conducive to the
               construction of superlattices or multilayer films. In this
               paper, persistent layer-by-layer growth of SRO thin films is
               demonstrated by regulating the growth conditions. As a result,
               the thickness can be precisely controlled down to a single unit
               cell (u.c.) and achieve precise regulation of superlattices.
               Interestingly, the physical properties are well comparable to
               that of traditional step-flow mode and the critical thickness
               (tc) for the dead layer is only 3 u.c. Through constructing
               SRO/STO superlattices, the SRO layers become more conductive and
               a quasi-2D ferromagnetic monolayer film is achieved. The results

              degree of functional tunability based on the chemical
              composition. Pulsed laser deposition is one of the multiple
              physical vapour deposition routes to fabricate thin films,
              employing laser energy to eject material from a target in the
              form of a plasma. A substrate, commonly a single-crystal oxide,
              is placed in the path of the plume and acts as a template for the
              arriving species from the target to coalesce and self-assemble
              into a thin film. This technique is tremendously useful to
              produce crystalline films, due to the wide range of atmospheric
              conditions and the extent of possible chemical complexity of the
              target. However, this flexibility results in a high degree of
              complexity, oftentimes requiring rigorous optimisation of the

              The overall dynamics of such a plume is governed by the species
              composition in particular if three or more elements are involved.
              We studied the temporal evolution of the plume, the composition
              of the chemical species in the plasma, as well as their electric
              charge. In particular, ionized species can have an important
              influence on film growth. Likewise, the different oxygen sources
              contributing to the overall oxygen content of an oxide film are
              presented and discussed. Important for the growth of oxide thin
              films is the compositional transfer of light element such as
              oxygen or Li. We will show and discuss how to monitor these light
              elements using plasma spectroscopy and plasma imaging and outline

              elucidate ion acceleration in laser-induced plasma plumes over a
              range of laser fluences important for pulsed laser deposition.
              The fundamental (1064 nm) or second (532 nm) harmonics of a
              Nd:YAG laser were used for ablation. The evolution of the
              time-of-flight ion signal from single-peaked to double-peaked and
              again to single-peaked with increasing laser fluence in the range
              of 2-25 J/cm(2) has been followed. The analysis of the ion
              velocity distributions shows that increasing laser fluence
              results in the appearance of a portion of accelerated ions that
              can be recognized as an additional fast peak in the
              time-of-flight distribution. The dependencies of the ion signal
              on the target-to-collector distance, the background pressure, and
              the wavelength of laser radiation have been studied. The results
              are discussed from the viewpoint of the generation of a
              self-consistent ambipolar electric field (so-called double
              layer). The observed ion acceleration suggests that formation in
              the plume of a high-energetic electron tail due to absorption of
              laser radiation is responsible for the development of a double

               imaging. The results provide a time-resolved understanding on
               how those process parameters affect the expansion: from a free
               expansion in vacuum with velocities exceeding 20 000 m/s to a
               very slow expansion in Ar at 1×10⁻¹ mbar with arrival
               velocities of 280 m/s. In addition, we observe a rebound of the
               ablated material on the substrate holder leading to a re-coating
               of the ablated target. At 1×10⁻¹ mbar, it seems that the
               expansion of the plasma plume displaces a considerable portion
               of the background gas and traps it against the frontal area of
               the substrate holder. This leads to a transient high local
               pressure just above the substrate. In the case of Ar, the
               rebound is enhanced due to inelastic scattering, whereas for an
               O₂ background, an area of high reactivity/emission in addition
               to the rebound is created. Imaging of selected species shows
               that the light emission in this area is mainly due to excited Ag

               above other techniques is the possibility to growth at relative
               high background pressures, with a large freedom in choosing the
               kind of gas. An example is oxygen in the case of high Tc
               superconductors and giant magnetic resistors. However, the
               advantage of relative high pressures hinders the use of a number
               of diagnostics and monitor techniques, like reflective high
               energy electron diffraction (RHEED). With the introduction of
               the possibility to use RHEED at standard PLD pressures, it
               became possible to study the growth of oxide materials under
               different oxygen and temperature conditions. In this paper we
               employed this technique on SrTiO3, which can be grown in
               different growth modes depending on growth temperature and
               oxygen pressure during deposition. Applying a modified etch
               treatment on SrTiO3 single crystals, a real 2D growth mode could
               be observed by the homo-epitaxial growth of SrTiO3, as indicated
               by RHEED oscillations. In addition to the RHEED oscillations

               diffracted pattern. This is caused by the mobility of the
               deposited material from a disordered distribution till an
               ordered one and leads to a characteristic exponential slope with
               characteristic relaxation time constants. These time constants
               give extra information about relaxation, crystallization, and
               nucleation of the deposited material during growth. Finally, a
               new approach to deposit these complex oxide materials will be
               introduced. This, so-called interval deposition, is based upon
               the results obtained from the intensity oscillations as well as
               relaxations. The basic idea is to deposit an equivalent of one
               unit cell of material in such a short time that no coalescence
               in larger islands can occur, followed by a relaxation time
               before the next unit cell layer is deposited. This interval
               deposition leads to an imposed layer by layer growth.",

               not give rise to complex and uncontrolled strain effects at low

               studied in situ with reflection high-energy electron diffraction
               and ex situ with scanning transmission electron microscopy,
               x-ray diffraction, and neutron reflectometry. The individual
               layers are found to be flat and continuous over long lateral
               distances with sharp and coherent interfaces and with a
               well-defined thickness of the individual layer. The only visible
               defects are antiphase boundaries in the YBCO layers that
               originate from perovskite unit-cell height steps at the
               interfaces with the LCMO layers. We also find that the first
               YBCO monolayer at the interface with LCMO has an unusual growth
               dynamics and is lacking the CuO chain layer, while the
               subsequent YBCO layers have the regular Y-123 structure.
               Accordingly, the CuO$\{\}_\{2\}$ bilayers at both the LCMO/YBCO
               and the YBCO/LCMO interfaces are lacking one of their
               neighboring CuO chain layers and, thus, half of their
               hole-doping reservoir. Nevertheless, from electric transport
               measurements on a superlattice with $n=2$ we obtain evidence
               that the interfacial CuO$\{\}_\{2\}$ bilayers remain conducting
               and even exhibit the onset of a superconducting transition at
               very low temperature. Finally, we show from dc magnetization and

               at rates exceeding 100 kfps, on in situ field-programmable gate
               array (FPGA) hardware to track magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) mode

                   diagnostics and therapeutic monitoring, particularly for
                   identifying diverse cell types involved in various diseases.
                   Traditional cell classification methods such as flow
                   cytometry depend on molecular labeling which is often
                   costly, time-intensive, and can alter cell integrity. To
                   overcome these limitations, we present a label-free machine
                   learning framework for cell classification, designed for
                   real-time sorting applications using bright-field microscopy
                   images. This approach leverages a teacher-student model
                   architecture enhanced by knowledge distillation, achieving
                   high efficiency and scalability across different cell types.
                   Demonstrated through a use case of classifying lymphocyte
                   subsets, our framework accurately classifies T4, T8, and B
                   cell types with a dataset of 80,000 preprocessed images,
                   accessible via an open-source Python package for easy
                   adaptation. Our teacher model attained 98\% accuracy in
                   differentiating T4 cells from B cells and 93\% accuracy in
                   zero-shot classification between T8 and B cells. Remarkably,
                   our student model operates with only 0.02\% of the teacher
                   model's parameters, enabling field-programmable gate array
                   (FPGA) deployment. Our FPGA-accelerated student model
                   achieves an ultra-low inference latency of just 14.5~$\mu$s
                   and a complete cell detection-to-sorting trigger time of
                   24.7~$\mu$s, delivering 12x and 40x improvements over the
                   previous state-of-the-art real-time cell analysis algorithm
                   in inference and total latency, respectively, while
                   preserving accuracy comparable to the teacher model. This

               referred to as High Energy Physics (HEP) experiments, study the
               constituents of matter and their fundamental interactions. By
               colliding proton on proton or heavy-ions, such as Au on Au or Pb
               on Pb at relativistic energies, one creates conditions that were
               prevalent within a microsecond after the birth of our universe.
               These collisions produce large number of highly energetic
               particles which are to be recorded by the experiments. This
               poses great challenges for particle detectors, readout
               electronics, and data acquisition (DAQ) systems including data
               storage. In addition, the radiation levels in the proximity of
               the detectors have also been growing, which demands for
               radiation tolerant devices. Traditional nuclear physics
               experiments employ detectors with several tens to few hundred of
               readout channels using standard electronics and conventional DAQ
               systems, which handles low data rate (few megabyte per second)
               and less resilient for data errors against multi-bit upset in
               radiation zones. In contrast the present day nuclear and HEP
               experiments, for example the LHC at CERN and FAIR at GSI
               Darmstadt, employ detectors with up to billions of electronics
               channels, which produce data at the rate of few terabyte (TB)
               per second. This requires a highly efficient system to cope with
               the increase in data volume by acquiring data at a high rate and
               recovery from data error against the multi-bit upsets in

               susceptible to errors. CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Checksum) is an
               efficient and simple cryptic algorithm has been in use among the
               software community since very long time to detect malicious
               changes in transmitted data. Recently hardware engineers are
               also interested in using it in their forward error detection
               scheme with low resource consumption overhead for their ultra
               high-speed data communication. To tap the full potential of CRC
               algorithm in hardware level, it must be implemented in a
               hardware friendly manner with proper user constraints. This
               paper presents a very high throughput low latency VLSI design
               architecture of CRC-32 with reconfigurable parameters. The high
               throughput is achieved by using expandable data bus line. While,
               low latency is made possible by parallelizing the logic
               implementation. The way this problem is approached is elegantly
               explained using detailed diagrams and mathematics, such that the
               readers find it easy to adapt the architecture to any CRC
               polynomial type/size. The uniqueness of our design lies in its
               ability to operate on the same clock cycle in which the code
               word is presented, with results produced in immediately next
               clock cycle. The effects of variations in design parameters of
               CRC VLSI design on performance characteristics is studied. Also,
               we have further extended the scope of utility of this component

               synchronous relationship between the signals needs to be
               preserved. Traditional electronic systems used for time
               measurement are designed using a classical mixed-signal
               approach. With the advent of reconfigurable hardware such as
               field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), it is more advantageous
               for designers to opt for all-digital architecture. Most
               high-speed serial transceivers of the FPGA circuitry do not
               ensure the same chip latency after each power cycle, reset
               cycle, or firmware upgrade. These cause uncertainty of phase
               relationship between the recovered signals. To address the need
               to register minute phase shift changes inside an FPGA, we
               propose a design for phase measurement logic core having
               resolution and precision in the range of a few picoseconds. The
               working principle is based on subsample accumulation using
               systematic sampling over the phase detector signal. The phase
               measurement logic can operate over a wide range of digital clock
               frequencies, ranging from a few kilohertz to the maximum
               frequency that is supported within the FPGA fabric. A
               mathematical model is developed to illustrate the operating
               principle of the design. The VLSI architecture is designed for
               the logic core. We also discussed the procedure of the phase

               −1.7\%) stabilized in the tetragonal distorted structure (with
               zero tilting). Our Berry curvature calculations predict a
               positive value of the anomalous Hall conductivity of +76 S/cm at
               −1.7\% strain, whereas it is found to be negative (−156 S/cm) at
               −0.47\% strain. We attribute the found behavior of the anomalous
               Hall effect to the nodal point dynamics in the electronic
               structure arising in response to tailoring the oxygen octahedral
               distortion driven by the substrate induced strain. We also
               calculate strain-mediated anomalous Hall conductivity as a
               function of reduced magnetization obtained by scaling down the
               magnitude of the exchange field inside Ru atoms finding good
               qualitative agreement with experimental observations, which
               indicates a strong impact of longitudinal thermal fluctuations
               of Ru spin moments on the anomalous Hall effect in this system.",

               skew, or/and side-jump scattering or to intrinsic Berry
               curvature in the conduction bands. While most SOT studies have
               focused on materials with heavy metal components, the oxide
               perovskite SrRuO3 has been predicted to have a pronounced Berry
               curvature. Through quantification of its spin current by the SOT
               exerted on an adjacent Co ferromagnetic layer, we determine that
               SrRuO3 has a strongly temperature ( T)-dependent spin Hall
               conductivity $\sigma$ SH, increasing with the electrical
               conductivity, consistent with expected behavior of the intrinsic
               effect in the ``dirty metal'' regime. $\sigma$ SH is very high
               at low T, e.g., $\sigma$ SH > (ℏ/2 e)3 $\times$ 105 $\Omega$-1
               m-1 at 60 K, and is largely unaffected by the SrRuO3
               ferromagnetic transition at T c $\approx$ 150 K, which agrees
               with a recent theoretical determination that the intrinsic spin
               Hall effect is magnetization independent. Below T c smaller
               nonstandard SOT components also develop associated with the
               magnetism of the oxide. Our results are consistent with the
               degree of RuO6 octahedral tilt being correlated with the
               strength of the SOI in this complex oxide, as predicted by
               recent theoretical work on strontium iridate. These results

               high-crystallinity and low residual resistivity (RR) is essential
               to explore its intrinsic properties. Here, utilizing the
               adsorption-controlled growth technique, the growth condition of
               initial SrO layer on TiO$$\_2$$ 2 -terminated SrTiO$$\_3$$ 3
               (STO) (001) substrate was found to be crucial for achieving a low
               RR in the resulting SRO film grown afterward. The optimized
               initial SrO layer shows a c(2 $$\times $$ × 2) superstructure
               that was characterized by electron diffraction, and a series of
               SRO films with different thicknesses (ts) were then grown. The
               resulting SRO films exhibit excellent crystallinity with
               orthorhombic-phase down to $$t \approx $$ t ≈ 4.3 nm, which was
               confirmed by high resolution X-ray measurements. From X-ray
               azimuthal scan across SRO orthorhombic (02 ± 1) reflections, we
               uncover four structural domains with a dominant domain of
               orthorhombic SRO [001] along cubic STO [010] direction. The
               dominant domain population depends on t, STO miscut angle
               ($$\alpha $$ α ), and miscut direction ($$\beta $$ β ), giving a
               volume fraction of about 92 $$\%$$ \% for $$t \approx $$ t ≈ 26.6
               nm and $$(\alpha , \beta ) \approx $$ ( α , β ) ≈

               5$$\textasciicircum{\mathrm{o}}$$ o ). On the other hand,
               metallic and ferromagnetic properties were well preserved down to
               t$$\approx $$ ≈ 1.2 nm. Residual resistivity ratio (RRR = $$\rho
               ({\mathrm{300 K}})$$ ρ ( 300 K ) /$$\rho ({\mathrm{5K}})$$ ρ ( 5
               K ) ) reduces from 77.1 for t$$\approx $$ ≈ 28.5 nm to 2.5 for
               t$$\approx $$ ≈ 1.2 nm, while $$\rho ({\mathrm{5K}})$$ ρ ( 5 K )
               increases from 2.5 $$\upmu \Omega $$ μ Ω cm for t$$\approx $$ ≈
               28.5 nm to 131.0 $$\upmu \Omega $$ μ Ω cm for t$$\approx $$ ≈ 1.2
